     <p>
      We all loooove our work right? Although some people, especially the ones who code, don't leave their work behind when leaving the office! We still think about our application logic, while we are at the gym, or if the new algorithm will improve the system's performance during dinner, or even discussing how to improve the UX of our application with our friends over drinks.
    </p>

    <h2 class="headlines">... but also love vacation.</h2>
    <p>
      Many of us are so blessed, that work doesn't even feel like work! So we don't even realize how many extra hours we put in to our work and projects.
      How many of you know how many vacation days you still have for this year? For that matter, when was your last vacation?!
    </p>
    <h2 class="headlines">This takes up so much time, doesn't it?</h2>
    <p>
      We all need a good "work-life balance", but organizing it takes so much time, time that we could spend doing so much other great stuff!
      The whole process of checking how many days are still available, then checking where and when to go, or if your family can join, or even if you can afford it, is just tiresome.
    </p>
    <h2 class="headlines">Just relax!</h2>
    <p>
      This is the reason, we've developed "just relax".
      It shows you how many work and vacation days are still left, and tells you if it's time for a vacation, and saves your preferences! Check out your new vacation location with just one click!
